# Final-Project-Homophobic-Tweets-Frequencies

Overview: This is a project based on analysing what topics are most often linked to the homophobic speech on Twitter. It utilises a 2017 database of hatespeech on Twitter titled“Hate speech offensive tweets” by Davidson et al. to see what topics were most common in homophobic hate speech. The project aims to understand what topics most often lead to derogatory and hateful language specifically targeted at the LGBTQ+ community, and hopefully raise awareness of which topics must be moderated to a greater extent on platforms like Twitter. 

Authors: Anna Zwolińska and Alex Gdańska.
